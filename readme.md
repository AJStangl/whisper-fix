### Configuring Actions for a Custom GPT to Assist Coders

Creating a custom GPT that assists coders requires careful configuration to ensure it meets the needs of its users. This
guide will provide a step-by-step process to configure an action for a GPT that can query Google or any other useful
external API. Follow these steps to build a robust and functional GPT assistant.

---

#### Step 1: Define Your API

First, you need to build the API that your GPT will interact with. This could be an internal API you control or an
external one like Google's search API.

**Example API Structure:**

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Code Assistant Action
  description: An action that allows the GPT to perform tasks such as querying Google for code-related information.
  version: 'v1'
servers:
  - url: https://yourapi.com
paths:
  /query:
    get:
      operationId: queryGoogle
      summary: Query Google for coding-related information
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: q
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
          description: The search query string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/QueryResponse'
components:
  schemas:
    QueryResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        results:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: The list of search results.
```

This defines a basic structure for querying Google. You would replace `https://yourapi.com` with the actual endpoint you
are using.

---

#### Step 2: Create the OpenAPI Specification

Once you have your API defined, create an OpenAPI specification to document it. This helps the GPT understand what it
can do with the API.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Code Assistant Action
  description: An action that allows the GPT to perform tasks such as querying Google for code-related information.
  version: 'v1'
servers:
  - url: https://yourapi.com
paths:
  /query:
    get:
      operationId: queryGoogle
      summary: Query Google for coding-related information
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: q
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
          description: The search query string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/QueryResponse'
components:
  schemas:
    QueryResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        results:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: The list of search results.
```

This specification defines the structure of the API and how it should be used. Make sure to include all necessary
details such as the parameters and responses.

---

#### Step 3: Host the OpenAPI Specification

For the GPT to use your API, you need to host the OpenAPI specification. This can be done on any server or service that
can serve static files.

**Hosting Options:**

- **GitHub Pages:** Simple and free for public APIs.
- **AWS S3:** Flexible and supports private APIs.
- **Your own server:** Full control over access and performance.

Once hosted, ensure the specification is accessible via a URL. This URL will be used in the GPT configuration.

---

#### Step 4: Configure the GPT in the ChatGPT UI

Now that your API and OpenAPI specification are ready and hosted, configure the GPT in the ChatGPT UI.

1. **Access the GPT Builder:**
    - Go to the ChatGPT platform.
    - Open the GPT builder for your account (available to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users).

2. **Start Creating Your GPT:**
    - Use the conversational interface to begin setting up your GPT.
    - Describe your GPT's purpose: "A GPT that assists coders by querying Google for coding-related information."

3. **Define the Actions:**
    - Import your hosted OpenAPI specification URL.
    - Ensure the GPT understands the endpoints and can call them appropriately.

4. **Set Up Instructions:**
    - Provide detailed instructions for your GPT. Include context on when to use the action and how to format requests.

**Example Instructions:**

```text
You are a coding assistant. Use the `queryGoogle` action to search for coding-related information when the user asks a question. The search query should be concise and relevant to coding topics.
```

#### Step 5: Implement Authentication for Secure API Access

Depending on your API's requirements, you may need to implement authentication. Common methods include API keys or
OAuth.

**API Key Authentication:**

If your API uses API keys, include the key in the headers of the requests.

**Example:**

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-KEY
security:
  - ApiKeyAuth: [ ]
```

**OAuth Authentication:**

For OAuth, you'll need to define the OAuth flows.

**Example:**

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    OAuth2:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://example.com/auth
          tokenUrl: https://example.com/token
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access
security:
  - OAuth2: [ read, write ]
```

Include these definitions in your OpenAPI specification to ensure secure access.

---

#### Step 6: Configure Action Responses

Ensure your GPT can handle and interpret responses from the API. Define the structure of the responses in your OpenAPI
specification.

**Example Response Schema:**

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    QueryResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        results:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: The list of search results.
```

This schema ensures that the GPT understands the structure of the data it will receive and can format it appropriately
for the user.

---

#### Step 7: Test Your Action

Before deploying, thoroughly test the action to ensure it works as expected.

**Testing Steps:**

1. **Simulate Requests:**
    - Use tools like Postman or curl to simulate API requests and ensure responses are correctly formatted.

2. **Use the GPT Builder's Test Function:**
    - In the GPT Builder, use the available actions section to test your configured actions.
    - Validate that the GPT correctly interprets and uses the API responses.

3. **Debug and Refine:**
    - Address any issues that arise during testing.
    - Ensure the GPT provides useful and accurate responses to user queries.

---

#### Step 8: Provide Detailed Instructions for the GPT

After successful testing, provide comprehensive instructions for the GPT to follow. These instructions help the GPT
understand when and how to use the configured action.

**Example Instructions:**

```text
You are an expert coding assistant. When a user asks a question related to coding, use the `queryGoogle` action to search for relevant information. 
Ensure the query is concise and specific to coding topics. Return the most relevant results to the user.

Example Interaction:
User: "How do I center a div in CSS?"
Action: Call the `queryGoogle` endpoint with the query "How to center a div in CSS".
Response: Return the top results to the user.
```

These instructions guide the GPT in using the action effectively and ensure it provides valuable assistance to users.

---

#### Step 9: Deploy and Monitor

Deploy your custom GPT once configuration and testing are complete. After deployment, monitor its performance and make
adjustments as necessary.

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Save Your Configuration:**
    - Ensure all configurations are saved in the GPT Builder.
    - Review all settings and instructions.

2. **Launch Your GPT:**
    - Deploy the GPT and make it available to users.
    - Announce the new functionality and encourage feedback.

3. **Monitor Usage:**
    - Use analytics and user feedback to monitor the GPT's performance.
    - Identify any areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments.

#### Step 10: Handle Errors Gracefully

It's important to ensure that your GPT can handle errors gracefully. This includes handling cases where the API fails, returns an error, or provides an unexpected response. Define error responses in your OpenAPI specification.

**Example Error Response:**
```yaml
components:
  responses:
    ErrorResponse:
      description: A generic error response
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              error:
                type: string
                description: Error message
paths:
  /query:
    get:
      operationId: queryGoogle
      summary: Query Google for coding-related information
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: q
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
          description: The search query string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/QueryResponse'
        "400":
          $ref: '#/components/responses/ErrorResponse'
        "500":
          $ref: '#/components/responses/ErrorResponse'
```

Instruct your GPT on how to handle these errors.

**Example Instructions:**
```text
If the API returns an error, apologize to the user and provide a generic response. For example, if the API returns a 400 or 500 error, say "I'm sorry, something went wrong while processing your request. Please try again later."
```

---

#### Step 11: Implement Logging and Monitoring

Logging and monitoring are crucial for maintaining the reliability and performance of your GPT. Implement logging to track API usage, errors, and performance metrics.

**Example Logging Setup:**
```yaml
paths:
  /query:
    get:
      operationId: queryGoogle
      summary: Query Google for coding-related information
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: q
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
          description: The search query string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/QueryResponse'
      x-logging:
        enabled: true
        logLevel: INFO
```

Use monitoring tools to keep an eye on your GPT's performance and quickly identify any issues.

import requests

def call_api_with_backoff(url, headers, retries=3):
    for attempt in range(retries):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        elif response.status_code == 429:
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt
            time.sleep(wait_time)
        else:
            response.raise_for_status()
